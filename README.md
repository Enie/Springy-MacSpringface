#  Spring Demo

a small demo app for springs

## Damped harmonic oscillator

spring force ~ -k * displacement
    where k is stiffness
    and displacement is the distance of the expanded spring position to equilibrium (resting position)

damping force: -bẋ
    where b is the damping value
    and ẋ is the first derivative of x, the change in displacement
